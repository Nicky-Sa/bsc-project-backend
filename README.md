## Bachelor of science final project | ‌Back-end 🪄
*Design and implementation of a user panel on the web for an IoT-based tracking system*

In this project, I've implemented a back-end for serving APIs to make the front-end dashboard functional. The data is stored in a Postgres database and is generated randomly. 
- Written in [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) and [Node 20](https://nodejs.org/en) 🤘🏻
- Empowered with Typescript 🧵
- Using Prisma ORM to work with the database 💿
- Using [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for requests 🌐
- With Cookies-based authentication and authorization 🍪
- Used by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) front-end dashboard, you can check [this repo](https://github.com/Nicki-Di/bsc-project-frontend/) for the front-end code 🧞‍♂️
